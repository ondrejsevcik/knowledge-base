# Avalanche 101

## Basics

- slope is less than 20° => no avalanche
- when you see an avalanche and there was noone buried, let the rescue team know so the don't have to fly there
- [Tyrol Rescue team app](https://www.leitstelle-tirol.at/leistungen/zusatzleistungen/) - sends your location directly to Tyrol rescue team


### Equipment

Do not ever go skiing offsite without proper equipment! The chances go rapidly down when you don't have any.

#### Time to rescue ⏳

- with full basic equipment - up to 15 minutes
- without probe - up to 26 minutes
- without any equipment - up to 60 minutes ⚠️ !!!People usually die after `15 minutes` under the snow!!!

#### Basic equipment (approx. 200€)

- Probe
- Shovel - metal, not plastic
- Bacon - do not buy used ones, they are usually crap

## Avalanche danger scale

1. okay
2. when slope inclination `> 35°` and there is a heavy load on a small area => keep distance when skiing
3. when slope inclination `> 30°`
4. don't go
5. no way

## After the avalanche

- realizing what happened `1-2 minutes`
- call for help `2 minutes`
- localization
- digging
- resuscitation
- keeping warm

### Localization

- first, run fast
- when your bacon starts beeping, run slower for better accuracy
- hold your bacon in horizontal level
- when less than `5m` close, go slowly
- from `2m` use X method to localize precizely
- use probe to find body in the snow
  - in `40cm` spiral
  - at a right angle to slope
  
### Digging

- dig horizontaly to place where is the body 
- dig in `V` shape
- first, find a head

kopat vodorovne k mistu kde je dotycny zakopan
pokud nas je vice, tak se stridat ve predu
idealne kopat do V
nejdrive najit hlavu


## Myths

### There is no avalanche in forest

Sure there is. It's even `more dangerous` than regular avalanche because of the trees! Only when the forrest is so dense, it may be avalanche free, but that's very unlikely. 

### Professionals will take care of me

`95%` of people will die after `15 minutes` in an avalanche. Average rescue team arrival time is about `15 mintes`. Your best chance for rescue are the people with you!

### Areas close to ski slopes are safe

There is not much difference between area next to the slope and some other in the wild. Both are covered with a fresh snow. Layers in areas close to the slopes may be disrupted because skiers cross them more often, but there is no guarantee.

### Snow fence doesn't help with avalanche

They are primarily employed to minimize the amount of snowdrift on roadways and railways.
